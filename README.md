# MaterialDatePicker-Google

And YES, google finally brought a super useful component - MaterialDatePicker and it complies with material design.
The new component is super rich and can both be used as a DatePicker and a DateRangePicker.
This repository is designed to bring you the steps I used to effectively use the new awesome component.

Moved to Material Design 3

This is what we hope to achieve.
